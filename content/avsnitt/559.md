Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2023 just after his keynote, Fredrik chats to [Cyrus Clarke](https://cyrus.website/) about plants, imagining things, exploring, and building. And not presenting speculative things as possible here right now. Daring to not be useful right now.

How to bridge the gap between theory and academia on one side and practice and industry wanting to build things right now? By example.

Do our short time scales and focus on iteration hurt us? Eighteen months sounds like an impossibly long timespan, because we think in two-week iterations of what we have and customers want right now.

Getting in touch with researchers. Adapt how you talk to people! Scientists and artists are very similar.

We are all at intersections between things.
