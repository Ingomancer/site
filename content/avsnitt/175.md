Fredrik talks to [Pete Hunt](https://twitter.com/floydophone) about monoliths, breaking them up and when not to. And of course React, how it came about and how the introduction to the world looked from the inside. How to handle releases of software and working with communication around it. What happens when you go from underdog to being the safe choice?

This episode was recorded during the developer conference [Ã˜redev 2015](https://vimeo.com/144824775), where Pete gave presentations on [monolith-first apps with Node](http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/monolith-first-apps-with-node-js) and [building React backends](http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/building-a-react-js-backend).
