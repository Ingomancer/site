Recorded at [Ã˜redev 2018](https://oredev.org/2018/home), Fredrik talks to Steve Klabnik about [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_%28programming_language%29) and [Webassembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). We talk a lot about error messages, based on Steve's talk on how Rust handles and displays error messages. We discuss Rust's error messages thinking an handling, but also error messages more in general, such how to think in order to produce error messages both developers and end users have a chance of understanding. Steve explains how and why the Rust compiler is switching from a pass-based compilation approach to a query-based approach to better facilitate partial recompilation upon smaller code changes. We also talk about Rust 2018, how Rust puts out new releases and what major features are on their way.

We then switch to talking about Webassembly. We discuss how Webassembly is moving along, among other things how it is getting better at playing well with others, enabling people to rely on Webassembly code without necessarily even needing to know about it.
