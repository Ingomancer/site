Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2024, Fredrik talks to [Laura Herman](https://www.lauramherman.work/about-me) about creativity, creation, and AI.

Among other things, we discuss:
* How the perspectives of different groups differ, and Laura talks about the many factors which inform how people feel about generative AI.
* Generative AI as curation. How and where in our work processes we want AI assistance.
* Dataset curation and specialized models, and how they can be important and interesting going forward. What happens if we have to be very picky about what we train models on?
* How are people working with sustainability for generative models?
* Laura's own research into AI and creativity, and how other inventions have affected creativity and art.
* Finally, we discuss curation, and the possibilities of alternate curation platforms for finding things you like.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
