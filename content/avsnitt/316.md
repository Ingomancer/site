Recorded at [Øredev 2018](https://oredev.org/2018/home), Fredrik talks VR with [Roshan Khan](https://twitter.com/roshan_khan). Why does he think AR will get accepted quicker even though he considers VR the more exciting area? We also discuss where exciting things are happening that you may not think of - like travel, education, medical training, and car sales. Responsiveness and content quality - big factors for great VR.
