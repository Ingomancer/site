Fredrik talks to Pedro Abreu about the magical world of type theory. What is it, and why is it useful to know about and be inspired by?

Pedro gives us some background on type theory, and then we talk about how type theory can provide new ways of reasoning about programs, and tools beyond tests to verify program correctness. This doesn't mean that all languages should strive for the nirvana of dependent types, but knowing the tools are out there can come in handy even if the code you write is loosely typed.

We wrap up with some further podcast tips, of course including Pedro's own podcast Type theory forall.
