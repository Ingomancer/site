Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2023 just after her keynote, Fredrik chats to [Diana Larsen](https://www.dianalarsen.com/about) about leadership and building good teams.

* How to get into leaderhip? Often it's more about picking up expectations than getting a formal onboarding
* Learning to not do things yourself when you start leading - everything you do is one less thing the team learns to do for itself
* Leadership roles are on different levels, and on a different level than non-leadership positions. A lot of thing can become invisible to people on other levels. Some things should be, others should be made visible. People want to be understood, and understand what other people in the organization are doing and what challenges they have.

And everything doesn't have to be a formal meeting with agendas and stuff.

Power dynamics - hard to percieve and to talk about. Even what location you are in can become part of the power dynamics and important to take into consideration.

Teams - they also exist on different levels. They don't have to be static.
