Fredrik chats with Craig Muth, creator of the more than slightly mind-bending Xiki about the past, present and future of this weird and wonderful evolution of the command line. Seeing Xiki in action is probably the best way to begin to grasp it, and Craig has created several great videos and screencasts.

We go all the way from Xiki's beginnings as a framework inside of Emacs to its current state as a standalone companion to your normal command line, and its just launched Kickstarter to take the next step and become social by making it super simple to share and find commands. We also look further into the future, entering completely free-form speculation about where things could go both for command lines and user-extendable interfaces. (Yes, Hyper card and Opendoc both come up.)

Don't assume things you want will happen - back things you want to succeed!

<!-- Cheer up the autumn: on October 3rd [Suse](https://www.suse.com/) is sponsoring a live pod and after work in Stockholm! 

We'll occupy Hobo at Brunkebergstorg 4. Doors open at 17, the pod commences somewhere around 18, and then we talk code, life, the universe, and everything and have some nice drinks for as long as we like.

We hope to see *you* there, and that you bring along a friend or two! The number of seats are limited, so send an email as soon as possible to [livepodd@gmail.com](mailto:lovepodd@gmail.com) with your name, company and if you're bringing anyone along. -->

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
