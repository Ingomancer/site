Fredrik has [Matt Topol](https://github.com/zeroshade) and [Lars Wikman](https://underjord.io/) over for a deep and wide chat about [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and many, *many* topics in the orbit of the language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data. What does that even mean? What is the point? And why does Arrow only feel more and more interesting and useful the more you think about deeply integrating it into your systems?

Feeding data to systems fast enough is a problem which is focused on much less than it ought to be. With Arrow you can send data over the network, process it on the CPU - or GPU for that matter- and send it along to the database. All without parsing, transformation, or copies unless absolutely necessary.
