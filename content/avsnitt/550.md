Recorded at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2022, Fredrik chats with [Natalia Tepluhina](https://www.nataliatepluhina.com/) about perhaps the most complicated part of frontend development: state management.

Why is state management so tricky, and what can we do about it? Natalia tells a fascinating story of a beautiful abomination of state management libraries in a single application.

Don't be the bottleneck. Some people enjoy it, but it doesn't do you any good (or your company for that matter). Natalia realized she had become one, and took action to resolve the issue.

Once we leave state behind us, we discuss documentation writing and contributions - in many ways it's actually harder than contributing to code. You need a much wider perspective, so the idea that documentation is some easy start to contributing isn't necessarily correct.

Finally: never forget to reach out! Report the issue, offer to help, ask for the feature, or whatever else it is that you've thought about doing but never got around to!
