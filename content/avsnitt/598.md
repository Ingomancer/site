Fredrik talks to [Jack Cheng](https://www.jackcheng.com/about/) - author and creator of the iPhone note capture app [Bebop](https://www.jackcheng.com/bebop-design-dev-process/). Jack describes where Bebop came from and how he built it, and how and why Copilot and other AI tools became integral parts of the workflow.

Being aware of the maintenance cost of each decision, keeping things focused, avoiding building yourself into a bloated corner - sometimes even deciding certain things don't belong in your app.

Coding on the side, needing to balance the time you have? Use it to your advantage!

Jack also talks about the other apps he uses for working with notes and writing, and how different apps feel right for different types of writing.

(Yes, [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_%28software%29) once again makes an appearance.)
