Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2023 just after the keynote, Fredrik chats to Galit Ariel about being inspired by the right science fiction.

* It's all thanks to Star Trek - a vision of the future which is actually positive and thoughtful
* What science fiction can teach us about what we think of as the other
* Uninspired future building - is it that things become so big they become more bland because they can't afford to not be wide and bland?
* Too much push for product and profit
* Microsoft, AI, and the panic to surf the current wave
* Will cultures change? Perhaps a recession will help - reality is biting a bit at the worst misdirections. When things are stale and still, more interesting and nuanced things have the time to happen
* Also: the new generation is looking good!
