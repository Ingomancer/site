Fredrik talks to [Jon Sterling](https://www.jonmsterling.com/) about user interfaces old and new. Jon has created Aquaui - a Mac user interface library which is a small love letter to the Aqua user interface style for Mac OS X. Based on that, we discuss understandable and consistent user interfaces, how there seems to be little evolution and improvement, wish for brave new ideas, and a lot more.

Oh, and we also discuss living with old technology, like a seventh-generation Ipod. Plus liability laundering and the problems of building the whole house of out fire alarms.
