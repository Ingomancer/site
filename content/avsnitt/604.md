Fredrik talks to Evan Czaplicki - creator of Elm

Turning points in working in open source, working on something for a long time, and in the public eye.

What do you do when you have a job which seems like it would be your dream job, but it turns out to be the wrong thing for you? And how do you escape from that?

You can't put the success of something you build before your own personal and mental health, no matter how right the decision may be for the thing you build.

Is there ever a reproducible path? Aren't most or all successful things in large part a result of their circumstances?

Platform languages and productivity languages - which do you prefer?

Thoughts on the tradeoffs of when and how to roll things out and when to present ideas.

Evan's development mindset and environment, and the ways it has affected Elm's design - all the way down to the error messages.
