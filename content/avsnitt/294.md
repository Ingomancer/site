Fredrik talks to Dan Lebrero, long-time Java developer turned Clojure developer, REPL-user, efficiency-thinker and more.

We discuss the wonders of REPL-driven development, and how it works. Dan opens Fredrik's eyes somewhat to the possibilities and how they happen. The REPL can complement TDD, and also probably kill test writing for those not completely test infected.

We also discuss finding good tools, learning them, and of course building your own tools. Have you learned Bash as well as it deserves?
