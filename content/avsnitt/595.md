Fredrik paid a visit to Hogia and got the opportunity to talk to [Woody Zuill](https://woodyzuill.com/) and [Martin Lassbo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinlassbo/) about mob programming, innovation, and keeping an open and curious mind.

Mob programming is still new.

Every time you say "that can't work", you tend to be proven wrong eventually. Try it, for a year or two. You can't evaluate things after trying it for just an hour or two, some things take much longer.

How frequently do you want to steer? Short iterations are valuable in that they give us more opportunities to steer work in a good direction.

Standardization stifles innovation. Sometimes you do want it, but it depends on which space you're in.

We had a process, but we still succeeded!

Where did the thought I have originate? All your thoughts started somewhere else. The things we most believe hide our biggest mistakes.
