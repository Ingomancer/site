Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2024, Fredrik talks to [Violet Whitney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/violetwhitney/) and [William Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmartin/) about the research they do into how we can interact with computers outside of the bounds of … well, a regular computer or phone.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
