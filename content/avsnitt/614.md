Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2024, Fredrik talks to IT security expert [David Jacoby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djacoby/) about his way into IT security. What was it like to get interested in computer security early on, and to try start working with it before there really was an awareness of even the need for more security information? And when did the switch happen from annoying but harmless viruses and malware to the modern information stealing and blackmailing?

Finally, a horror movie tip.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
