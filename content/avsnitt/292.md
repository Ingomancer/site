Fredrik talks to Bartosz Milewski - programmer, writer and creator of mind-expanding presentations - about a wide range of things in the lands between mathematics and programming. Bartosz explains his increasing interest in mathematics, type and category theory and why he thinks mathematics and programming can and are coming closer together.

We eventually get to the topic of Bartosz' talk last year, and perhaps the only way humans can understand things and how that affects what we discover. Perhaps even what we are able to discover.

Recorded on stage at [Øredev 2018](http://oredev.org/2018).
