Recorded at the [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2022 developer conference, Fredrik chats with [Aino Vonge Corry](https://metadeveloper.com/) about [patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and their effects on our lives.

Aino works with both academia and industry, regularly switching between the two, and talks about what each can and wants to learn from the other.

We also discuss Aino's own research, and how programming languages and patterns influence each other. We talk about teaching patterns - and who teaches the teachers to teach.

It is easy to get stuck thinking that the patterns in the book are the one true list, when the whole power of a pattern is giving a name to some common thing in your own environment so that you can discuss it at a higher level.

Which are the patterns in your organization?

Perhaps you too could be helped by trying a double bottleneck?

Also: antipatterns! They help you learn from mistakes, and make it easier to talk, reason, and joke about them.
