Massor av glass! Chokladsås, strutar, smaker. Skidåkare?

Fredrik talks to [Christian Clausen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thedrlambda/) about the many facets of simplicity. 

The cloud and serverless was supposed to be simpler than running your own hardware, but you easily get stuck trying to select the right message bus, needing to know the intricacies of your chosen cloud provider infrastructure, and the like. You end up building your software around the infrastructure you've ended up with - rather than picking infrastructure which is right for your software.

The CFO should not be the architect of the software.

Core values and principles - set them up, reflect on them, and notice and decide what to do when they are broken. Should the system change if its core principles are broken, or should the principles be updated to reflect reality? Christian argues simplicity should be a core principle, and very carefully considered and encouraged.

There are enough barriers already, even before you start adding complexity around the problems you're trying to solve.

And hide the things you do pull in behind true abstractions which don't leak all over the place.

Don't ask what you can add, ask what you can postpone.

Generality adds complexity. The more often something changes, the more specific it should be.

Where are the tools which suggest more things to remove instead of things to add?
