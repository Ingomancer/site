We chat with [Rob Ashton](http://codeofrob.com/), freelance developer, speaker and recent discoverer of how to learn things properly, live on stage during [Øredev](http://www.oredev.org) 2014. Topics include learning, the plateaus of learning and how to actually do things right to keep evolving and learning. The problems of frameworks wanting to make X easy. Perhaps we should learn about programming in general instead of learning the next big framework in the hope that it will solve our problems without us needing to understand them?

This recording exists as good as it is thanks to [Stephen Chin](http://steveonjava.com/) of [nighthacking.com](http://nighthacking.com/) for providing and masterfully wrangling all the necessary technology.
