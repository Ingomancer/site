Recorded at [Devsum 2019](https://www.devsum.se/), Kristoffer and Fredrik talk burnout and more with [Heather Wilde](https://twitter.com/heathriel). Sometimes you really need the right kind of abrasive person in your life, or keep being that annoying friend to someone else. Heather shares some of her own experiences with burnout, breaking free from notifications, and tips for dealing with stress. Spoiler: it doesn't have to be yoga!

Last but not least, Heather tells us a bit about [Antarcticonf](https://antarcticonf.com/), the conference at the end of the world.
