Recorded at Gothenburg startup hack 2017, a little celebration of being social around coding. Fredrik chats to first Erik Thorelli of the Gothenburg Sketch & design meetup, then Erik Larkö of the Bring your own project Gothenburg group. Topics stretch from what Sketch is and what it can do for you, over group recommendations, to side projects, where to find ideas and how to get over whichever obstacles we put up in our minds to playing with new things.
