Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2024, Fredrik talks to [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/) and [Beth Andres-Beck](https://blog.bethcodes.com/) about development practices, code reviews, and more.

Unfortunately, sound quality is a lot worse than it should be. We apologize, and invite any sound processing wizards out there to get in touch if they have solid ways of improving it.

Has there actually been a backlash - a move toward more rigid processes? And what can we do about that? The development process is a shadow cast by the power structure, and in big organizations, you need someone who's job it is to read all the documents.

Also: improving code reviews, and how breaking the build can land you in a room with exactly the right people.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
