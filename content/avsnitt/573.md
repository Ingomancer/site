Fredrik is joined by [Emil Privér](https://priver.dev/about/) and [Leandro Ostera](https://twitter.com/leostera) for a discussion of the [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) ecosystem, and making it Saas-ready by building [Riot](https://riot.ml/).

First of all: OCaml. What is the thing with the language, and how you might get into it coming from other languages? The OCaml community is nice, interested in getting new people in, and pragmatic. And it has a nice mix of research and industry as well.

Then, Leandro tells us about Riot - an experiment in bringing everything good about the Erlang and Elixir ecosystems into OCaml. The goal? Make OCaml saas-ready. Riot is not 1.0 just yet, but an impressive amount has been built in just five(!) months.

Emil moves the discussion over to the mindset of shipping, and of finding and understanding good ideas in other places and picking them up rather than reinventing the wheel. Leandro highly recommends reading the code of other projects. Read and understand the code and solutions others have written, re-use good ideas and don't reinvent the wheel more often than you really have to.

Last, but by no means least, shoutouts to some of the great people building the OCaml community, and a bit about Emil's project [DBCaml](https://priver.dev/blog/dbcaml/dbcaml/).
