Fredrik talks to [Kai Dombrowski](https://twitter.com/airkai) and [Malin Sundberg](https://twitter.com/malinsundberg) of [Triple glazed studios](https://tripleglazedstudios.com/) about their new weather app [Mercury weather](https://twitter.com/mercuryweather).

Malin and Kai tell us how the app went from idea to release in a few short months, and why they will try not to pick the summer months the next time they start a new app. What was the release like, what was it like to be mentioned by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/), and how did that change the bug reports?

Do people care about weather apps? Yes, they very much do! We also talk weater API:s, easter eggs, and a whole lot more.

We wrap up with some chat about Fredrik's recent (lack of) Mac devleopment, the right phone size, and this year's Iphones 
in general.
