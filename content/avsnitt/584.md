Can I do something about that whine in Malin's sound?

Tornados och andra väderfenomen? Regissörsstolar för Malin och Kai?

Fredrik is joined by Malin Sundberg and Kai Dombrowski for a quick chat about the [Deep dish Swift](https://deepdishswift.com/) conference, the past and present of  [Mercury weather](https://mercuryweather.app/), their next app project, and what might happen at Apple's WWDC in June.

[Deep dish Swift](https://deepdishswift.com/) - the conference, Malin and Kai's interview podcast beforehand, and the differences between indie developers.

The evolution of Mercury since the last episode - especially the trip forecast feature. Yes: timezones were a big part of the challenge. The secret marketing advantage of having a Mac version of your IOS app.

Malin and Kai's movie industry project - an app for planning shoot days for movies and TV. A project which has given them lots of insight into the quirks of a whole new industry, and made them see whole different things in movies they watch.

VR gaming and work.

Bringing Mercury to Vision pro - a quick process, but some interesting adjustments required.

WWDC wishes and ideas.

Malin and Kai's summer project: a kanban-style workflow tracking app. Done with paper cuts!

Good deadlines. If Apple gives you one, you take it!

Some speculation about Apple's coming focus on "AI" and how that might work together with apps.
