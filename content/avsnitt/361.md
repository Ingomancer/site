Recorded at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2019, Fredrik talks to [Marianne Bellotti](https://twitter.com/bellmar); keynote speaker, software anthropologist and frequent modernizer of legacy systems.

We start our discussion talking about modernizing old yet mission critical systems, while they're still being used, without breaking everything. "Legacy" might invoke ancient software, but even a young system can have a lot of legacy which has not been updated in a surprisingly long time. From there we move on to code as the new pottery shards - coming to understandsing software from a perspective of anthropology - it's a surprisingly natural and interesting way to approach legacy systems.

We also talk about mindmapping and knowledge transfer, how to teach people to think like that amazing code reviewer instead of asking the  reviewer all the time.

Finally, we talk about how and why people feel the need to back their ideas up with research, or  not, and how an idea can run away from you and suddenly become truth just because you happened to package it well.
