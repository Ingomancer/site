[Paul Frazee](https://pfrazee.hashbase.io/) returns to discuss the evolution of [Beaker](https://www.beakerbrowser.com/) - the peer-to-peer browser for web hackers. Just  released as a public beta, Beaker has gone through a lot of changes [since October](https://kodsnack.se/336/) when we last chatted. Paul tells us about what Beaker is and some of the important concepts, such as feeds, the file system, and starting to create things on top of them.

On the surface, Beaker looks like a standard web browser with some unusual buttons, but just below the UI there's a lot of peer-to-peer technology, a serverless model of the web where you can just as easily edit, add, and remix as you can browse.

Beaker feels like a tool to make the web open and easily editable - something anyone can pick up and start hacking on without strange hurdles of server setups, package management, hosting fees, and build scripts.

We also talk about the very iterative and open development process of Beaker, and the high value of user testing. Paul talks about some of the many interesting problems left to solve, and the reasons why they're better solved later.
