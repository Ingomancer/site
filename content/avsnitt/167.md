From the podcaster's corner at [Devsum 16](http://www.devsum.se/), Fredrik talks to [Basia Fusinska](http://barbarafusinska.com/) about data science, R and data analysis. We discuss the ethics and science around data science and analysis. All of us are giving out a lot of data all the time, and there are so many aspects worth considering around what and how we give our data away. Briefly, we talk about what impressions we have of the .NET community, an impression which is changing even as we speak.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!

The Kodsnack book club is coming back! Our next book is the short story [Binti](http://www.tor.com/2015/08/17/excerpts-binti-nnedi-okorafor/) by [Nnedi Okorafor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnedi_Okorafor). It is a short and sweet read and can be found in many places, like [this](http://www.sfbok.se/produkt/binti-148570) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010GJG4PE/ref=kics_hp_typ_dp).
