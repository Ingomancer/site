Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2023 just after her keynote, Fredrik chats to [Na'Tosha Bard](https://natoshabard.com/) about picking good building blocks, getting products done, and code outliving you.

Software outlives you. How early is it meaningful to consider that fact?

Will we get better at handling long-lived software?

Make tradeoffs with open eyes.

Na'Tosha has worked on many different levels of hardware and software, as well as many different levels in organizations - what can be picked up from the various levels?
