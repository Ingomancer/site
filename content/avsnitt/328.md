Fredrik talks to [Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/) - web performance expert, [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_%28software%29) [instance maintainer](https://toot.cafe/web/getting-started), creator of a highly accessible Mastodon web client, and more. We discuss, among other things, the joys of distributed social media, where unlike centralized places like Twitter nobody can stop innovation when it comes to clients and interfaces and ways of use. Nolan talks about how and why he built [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/) - his Mastodon client. We touch on the different experiences people have and want out of social media, digital wellness, and how caring about performance cam be an act of empathy.
