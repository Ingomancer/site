Recorded at [Øredev 2018](https://oredev.org/2018/home), Fredrik talks to [Judy Rees](https://judyrees.co.uk/). We start from Judy's presentation [Getting them to get it](https://vimeo.com/302043072) and discuss the challenges of really listening, communication, and the how the [clean language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Language) technique can help you both understand others better, and get your own ideas across better as well.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
