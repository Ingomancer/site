Fredrik talks to [James Turnbull](http://www.twitter.com/kartar) of Kickstarter, Docker and several other companies. Topics range from switching between types of companies and solutions to writing books, documentation and contributing to software in ways other than code. Of course, we also discuss Docker, whether it's succeeded in various ways and where it might be going. Who should be thinking about Docker? How to start thinking about it? Where do you start picking on your monolith to start bringing it into the container future?

This episode was recorded during the developer conference [Ã˜redev 2015](https://vimeo.com/144824775), where James gave a presentation on [Orchestrating Docker](https://vimeo.com/144803754).
