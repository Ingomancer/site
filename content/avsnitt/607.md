Fredrik talks to [Balint Erdi](https://balinterdi.com/) about the web framework [Ember](https://emberjs.com/). Where did Ember come from, what stands out about it today, how do new features get into the framework, and how is development being made more sustainable?

Plus: Balint's experiences organizing [Emberfest](https://emberfest.eu/), and quite a bit of appreciation for the Ruby and Ember communities in general.

The episode is sponsored by [Cursed code](https://www.cursedcode.se/) - a half-day conference with a halloween mood taking place on October 31st, in central Gothenburg.
