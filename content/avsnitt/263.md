From Swampup 2018, Tobias and his colleague [Tamás Szelei](http://szelei.me/) summarize the conference, their impressions and the talks. Liquid software, mentalists, talks way over your head and speakers who are an aquired taste.

Then, Tobias and [Jerry Wiltse](https://twitter.com/solvingj) discuss Bincrafters and their work on creating packages for Conan. The quest to make Conan the NPM of C++.

Finally Tobias chats with [Diego Rodriguez-Losada](https://www.twitter.com/diegorlosada) - who discussed [Conan in episode 198](https://kodsnack.se/198/) - about his experience of the conference and the Conan aspect and community in particular. Conan's two user groups - the open source side who basically wants Conan to be the NPM of C++, and the enterprise side with people like Tobias, who are interested in controlling their whole stack without relying on external packages and want to control of the whole toolchain.
