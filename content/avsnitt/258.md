Recorded at [Øredev 2017](http://oredev.org/2017), Fredrik talks to [Marco Ceccione](https://twitter.com/sklivvz) about the ZX Spectrum, positive hacking (the only kind there is!), the benefits of getting closer to the metal and finally balancing coding and management.

Marco is an engineering manager at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/). Before that, he worked at Stack overflow, where, among other things, he wrote object-oriented assembly to solve real-wold problems on a huge scale. Yes, that's a real thing, discussion and links explains it all.
