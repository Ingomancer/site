Fredrik talks VR with [Az Balabanian](https://twitter.com/azadux). Az is director of photogrammetry at [Realities.io](http://realities.io/), likes flying cameras and hosts the excellent [Research VR podcast](https://twitter.com/researchvrcast). We cover how VR is coming along, how it has evolved since 2016, and what exciting things are happening right now. We also discuss how you might get started with VR, as a developer or otherwise, how Az and other do exciting work in VR, and some of the interesting ethical questions being raised. Hopefully we won't make all the mistakes of social networks again in VR.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
