This episode is presented in English.

We chat with [Diego Rodriguez-Losada](https://www.twitter.com/diegorlosada) about the C and C++ package manager Conan. Where did it come from, where is it going, the philosophy behind it (very, very pragmatic) and how Tobias has put it to use at Plex. We also move on to package managers and build systems in general. Also: the interesting topic of being magical versus not.
