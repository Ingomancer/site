Fredrik discusses VR with [Noah Falstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Falstein) of [the Inspiracy](http://www.theinspiracy.com/) (and previously companies such as Google and Lucasfilm games). We talk about where VR is today, which platforms are good today and what might happen going forward. VR might be on the verge of a big breakthrough but there is still a lot left to be discovered, from ways of controlling experiences to entire new genres.

Recorded on stage at [Ã˜redev 2017](http://oredev.org/2017).
