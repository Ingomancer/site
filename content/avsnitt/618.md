Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2024, Fredrik talks to [Ingrid af Sandeberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingridafsandeberg/) about AI and people's perception of it. While it's very powerful to be able to interact with models through natural language, that interface in itself hides a lot of what's actually going on. 

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
