Fredrik talks to [Woody Zuill](https://twitter.com/woodyzuill), writer of [the book on mob programming](https://leanpub.com/mobprogramming), facilitator of happy teams and thoughtful teller of stories. Woody talks about how he and his team discovered mob programming, how it is evolving, how focusing on the good is the way forward, and how he may have aquired his mindset. Recorded on-stage at [Øredev 2018](http://oredev.org/2018/home).
