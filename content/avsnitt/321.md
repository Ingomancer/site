Recorded at [Øredev 2018](https://oredev.org/2018/home), Fredrik talks to [Lisette Sutherland](https://lisettesutherland.com/) about making remote teams work, and working in remote teams. Lisette works remotely, manages remote teams, does extensive research, [podcasts](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/podcasts/) and has written [a book on the subject](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/). We cover topics from good tools to handling manager worries about remote work. And when Lisette talks tools it is not just your everyday Skype for business software replacements. I did not think about holograms as a good tool for remote work before talking to Lisette.
