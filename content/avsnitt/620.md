Fredrik talks to Dejan Milicic about software development - understanding, methods, and stories.

Encapsulation of knowledge and the essential software in organizations. Almost every organization should be developing software that solves their unique problems, and yet so many outsource so much of their knowledge encapsulation. Oh, and we can never completely encapsulate our knowledge in code either, so all the more reason to keep people who actually know what the code does and why around.

Abstractions to simplify.

Dejan's way to Ravendb and a developer relations role - crafting your own job. Stepping suitably outside of your comfort zone.

We also talk about shortening attention spans, daring to dig down a bit and find out about the context of things. Like the second sentence of some oft-repeated quote. Prohibit bad things, but help automate doing good things and avoid doing the bad things completely.

Database backstories - why would someone want to build one more database? Specifically, what lead to the creation of Ravendb? And with very strong opinions. Avoiding falling into marketing-driven development.

Every organization is unique - which strongly speaks against adapting the "best practices" and methodologies of others. Or keeping things completely the same for too long. Innovation is also about doing what other people are not doing.

Why is concurrency still hard? The free lunch has been over for twenty years! Functional programming and immutability offer ways forward, why aren't these concepts spreading even more and faster? We get right back to understanding more context when Dejan discusses how few of us seem to have understood, just for example, the L in SOLID. Dive deeper, read more, and you will find new things and come up with new ideas.

Finally, Dejan would like to see software development becoming just a little bit more mathematical. So that things can be established, verified and built on in a different way.
