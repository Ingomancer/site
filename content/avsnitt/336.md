Fredrik talks to [Paul Frazee](https://pfrazee.hashbase.io/) about [Beaker browser](https://www.beakerbrowser.com/) and making the web more peer-to-peer rather than client-server. Beaker also aims to make it radically easier to create and publish your own content rather Paul explains what Beaker browser is and the technologies it builds on. The central piece of technology is the distributed file system [Hyperdrive](https://awesome.datproject.org/hyperdrive) and the [DAT protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/) which provides a sort of file- and folder-based API for building applications and handling their data.

Paul discusses the hard problems of Beaker and P2P networks - such as deciding when and how you as a peer start to share something online in the system. Sharing everything all the time does not feel like the right solution to the problem. We also discuss how to think about things more like applications and dynamic web sites in the Beaker way.
