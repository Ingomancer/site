Fredrik is again joined by [Malin Sundberg](https://mastodon.social/@malin) and [Kai Dombrowski](https://mastodon.social/@kaidombrowski) for a review of attending this year's WWDC, 

The experience of attending - a lot about the great community.
News from the conference - a Snow leopard year, in a good way. Lots of nice fixes and additions - Swiftui, fun widgets, and of course lots of question marks around whatever Apple intelligence will grow up to be. And of course a little side of the ongoing story of Apple versus the EU.

Apple intelligence also leads naturally into a discussion on how everyone works with language models, copilots, and so on.
