Fredrik talks to [Rachel Reese](http://rachelree.se/about/) about F#, Xamarin, the [the MIT study](http://rachelree.se/the-mit-study/) (on diversity, sexism and career for women faculty at MIT) and related topics. We also cover good communities and being allowed (by yourself and others) to be a beginner.

This episode was recorded during the developer conference [Ã˜redev 2015](https://vimeo.com/144824775), where Rachel gave [two](https://vimeo.com/144692770) [talks](https://vimeo.com/144824775).
