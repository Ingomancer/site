Fredrik talks to [Aaron Gustafson](https://aaron-gustafson.com/) about web standards. His origin story, how he got into web standards. How the standards work and who should get involved. The problems with prefixes and how we use them.

This episode was recorded during the developer conference [Ã˜redev 2015](https://vimeo.com/144824775), where Aaron gave [two](https://vimeo.com/144870932) [talks](https://vimeo.com/144979022).
