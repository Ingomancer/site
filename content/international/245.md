Fredrik chats with [Steve Klabnik](https://www.steveklabnik.com/) about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), why the lucky stiff, [Closure](http://words.steveklabnik.com/the-closure-companion) and Webassembly.

What does Steve do, how is Rust coming along and how does the process work?

Who was why the lucky stiff and why does his publication later named Closure matter to people?

Finally: Webassembly, making the web good for applications in general and why Steve thinks it will be the biggest thing since Javascript was added to browsers.

Recorded on stage at [Øredev 2017](http://oredev.org/2017).
