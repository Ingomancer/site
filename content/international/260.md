Tobias and Fredrik talk to [Erez Zukerman](https://twitter.com/the_ezuk), CTO of Ergodox EZ, creators of the ergonomic mechanical keyboard of the same name. Tobias is a fan and user since a while back, and Erez tells us about why you decide to make a keyboard, how you manage to ship hardware on time the first time, how things are going and a little bit about what's in store for the future of Ergodox EZ. We wrap up with a few listener questions. If you have more, just send them to Erez or us, we will grab any reasons to talk even more about keyboards! Thanks a lot for taking the time Erez!
